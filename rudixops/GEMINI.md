# Gemini Workspace

This is your personalized workspace, powered by Gemini. Here's what you need to know:

- **Context is Key:** I have access to the files and context of this project. The more information you provide, the better I can assist you.
- **Tools at your Disposal:** I can read, write, and search files, as well as run shell commands. 
- **Iterative Process:** We can work together to build, debug, and refine your project. Don't hesitate to provide feedback and ask for changes.
